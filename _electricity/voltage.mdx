# Voltage: The Driving Force of Electrical Energy

Voltage is a fundamental concept in the realm of electricity and electronics, providing the driving force for the movement of electric charge. Understanding voltage is essential for anyone interested in working with electrical systems or pursuing a career in electrical engineering. In this article, we will explore the concept of voltage, its measurement, and its significance in practical applications.

## What is Voltage?

Voltage, also known as electric potential difference, is the potential energy per unit charge between two points in an electric circuit. It represents the driving force that pushes electric charges, such as electrons, through a conductor. Voltage is denoted by the symbol "V" and is measured in volts (V).

## Voltage Difference and Electric Fields:

The presence of a voltage difference between two points creates an electric field. This electric field exerts a force on electric charges, causing them to move from a region of higher potential (higher voltage) to a region of lower potential (lower voltage). The greater the voltage difference, the stronger the electric field and the higher the potential energy per unit charge.

## Measuring Voltage:

Voltage can be measured using a device called a voltmeter. A voltmeter is connected in parallel across the points where the voltage difference needs to be measured. It measures the potential difference between those points and displays the voltage value in volts (V) or millivolts (mV) for smaller voltages.

## Voltage Sources:

Voltage is supplied by various sources, such as batteries, power supplies, and generators. These sources create a potential difference, enabling the flow of electric current in a circuit. Batteries provide direct current (DC) voltage, while power stations typically generate alternating current (AC) voltage.

## Voltage in Circuits:

In an electric circuit, voltage is responsible for pushing electric charges through the circuit elements. It can be visualized as the "pressure" or "push" that moves electrons along a conductive path. Voltage is commonly encountered in relation to the following circuit elements:

**Voltage Source:** A voltage source, such as a battery or power supply, provides a specific voltage level that drives the current flow in a circuit.

**Resistors:** Resistors, as mentioned in the previous article, introduce resistance to the flow of current. The voltage drop across a resistor is proportional to the current flowing through it, according to Ohm's Law (V = IR).

**Capacitors:** Capacitors store electrical energy in an electric field. When a voltage is applied across a capacitor, it charges up, storing energy in the form of an electric field.

**Inductors:** Inductors store energy in a magnetic field. When the current through an inductor changes, a voltage is induced that opposes the change in current flow.
