## Early Life and Education

Born on March 16, 1789, in Erlangen, Bavaria, George Simon Ohm displayed an aptitude for mathematics and physics from a young age. He received his education at the University of Erlangen, where he studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy under the guidance of prominent professors.

## Ohm's Law and Electrical Resistance

Ohm's most significant contribution to science came in 1827 when he published his seminal work, "Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet" ("The Galvanic Circuit Investigated Mathematically"). In this publication, Ohm presented his groundbreaking law, now known as Ohm's Law, which states that the electric current passing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage applied across it and inversely proportional to the resistance of the conductor.

Mathematically, Ohm's Law can be expressed as:

$V = I*R$

Where:

- V represents voltage (measured in volts)
- I represents current (measured in amperes)
- R represents resistance (measured in ohms)

Ohm's Law forms the foundation for understanding and analyzing electrical circuits, allowing engineers and scientists to calculate the behavior of currents and voltages in various systems.

## Ohm's Scientific Legacy

Ohm's groundbreaking work on electrical resistance not only provided a quantitative relationship between the key parameters of electric circuits but also led to significant advancements in electrical engineering and technology. His contributions laid the groundwork for numerous scientific and technological developments, including:

### Development of Electric Circuits
