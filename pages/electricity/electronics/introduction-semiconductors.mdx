### Introduction to Semiconductors

Semiconductors are materials that have electrical conductivity between conductors and insulators. They are essential in the field of electronics, enabling the creation of various electronic devices. In this section, we will explore the key concepts related to semiconductors.

#### Atomic Structure of Semiconductors

Semiconductors are typically crystalline materials composed of atoms. Understanding the atomic structure is crucial to comprehend the behavior of semiconductors. We will delve into the arrangement of atoms and the role it plays in determining the electrical properties of semiconductors.

#### Energy Bands

The energy band structure of semiconductors provides insights into their electrical behavior. We will examine the valence band, conduction band, and band gap, and how they affect the conductivity of semiconductors. The concept of energy bands helps us understand the distinction between conductors, insulators, and semiconductors.

#### Doping of Semiconductors

Doping is the process of intentionally introducing impurities into semiconductors to alter their electrical properties. We will discuss the two types of doping: n-type and p-type. By introducing impurities, we can control the conductivity and create the foundation for various semiconductor devices.

#### Formation of p-n Junctions

The p-n junction is a crucial component in semiconductor devices. It is formed by bringing together p-type and n-type regions of a semiconductor. We will explore the behavior of p-n junctions, including the formation of a depletion region and the emergence of important device characteristics.

By studying the introduction to semiconductors, you will gain a solid foundation in understanding the principles underlying the behavior of semiconductors. This knowledge is essential for comprehending the functioning of various electronic devices and circuits.

Next, let's explore diodes and rectifiers in section 6.2.
