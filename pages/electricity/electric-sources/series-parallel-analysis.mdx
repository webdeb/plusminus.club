title: "5.2 Series and Parallel Circuit Analysis"
---

In this section, we will explore series and parallel circuits and learn how to analyze them. Understanding the behavior of series and parallel circuits is crucial in designing and troubleshooting electrical systems.

### Series Circuits

A series circuit is a configuration in which the components are connected end-to-end, forming a single path for current flow. In a series circuit, the same current flows through each component, and the total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances.

In this topic, we will cover the following subtopics:

- Calculation of total resistance in a series circuit
- Voltage distribution in a series circuit
- Current calculation in a series circuit
- Series circuit examples and calculations

### Parallel Circuits

A parallel circuit is a configuration in which the components are connected across common connection points, creating multiple paths for current flow. In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each component is the same, and the total current is the sum of the individual currents.

In this topic, we will cover the following subtopics:

- Calculation of total resistance in a parallel circuit
- Current distribution in a parallel circuit
- Voltage calculation in a parallel circuit
- Parallel circuit examples and calculations
