# Capacitor

A capacitor is an electronic component that stores and releases electrical energy. It consists of two conductive plates separated by a non-conductive material called a dielectric. The conductive plates can be made of metal, while the dielectric is typically an insulating material like ceramic, plastic, or electrolyte.

When a voltage is applied across the capacitor, it charges up by accumulating electric charges on its plates. The positive charges accumulate on one plate, while the negative charges accumulate on the other plate. The dielectric material prevents direct electrical contact between the plates, but it allows an electric field to form between them.

The amount of charge that a capacitor can store is determined by its capacitance, which is measured in Farads (F). The capacitance depends on factors such as the surface area of the plates, the distance between them, and the properties of the dielectric material. A larger surface area, closer plate distance, and higher permittivity of the dielectric material result in a higher capacitance.

## Configurations

The above formula represents the capacitance (F) based on the relation of charge (Q) and voltage (V). However, to calculate the capacitor based on its physical properties we have to look for different capacitor configurations and the corresponding formulas.

Here are the different formulas for capacitance based on different capacitor configurations and scenarios:

1. Capacitance of a Parallel-Plate Capacitor with Vacuum:

<MathBlock>**$C = \text{\(\frac {ε₀ * A} d\)}$**</MathBlock>

2. Capacitance of a Parallel-Plate Capacitor with Dielectric Material:
   C = (ε₀ _ εᵣ _ A) / d

3. Capacitance of a Spherical Capacitor:
   C = (4π _ ε₀ _ εᵣ _ R₁ _ R₂) / (R₂ - R₁)

   Where R₁ and R₂ are the radii of the inner and outer spheres respectively.

4. Capacitance of a Cylindrical Capacitor:
   C = (2π _ ε₀ _ εᵣ \* L) / ln(b / a)

   Where L is the length of the cylinder, a and b are the radii of the inner and outer cylinders respectively.

5. Capacitance of a Coaxial Cable:
   C = (2π _ ε₀ _ εᵣ \* L) / ln(b / a)

   Where L is the length of the cable, a and b are the radii of the inner and outer conductors respectively.

6. Capacitance of a Capacitor with Multiple Dielectrics:
   C = C₁ + C₂ + C₃ + ... (for capacitors with dielectric layers in parallel)

   Where C₁, C₂, C₃, ... are the capacitances of individual dielectric layers.

These formulas cover some of the most common capacitor configurations. Depending on the specific shape, arrangement, and dielectric used, the formulas may vary. It's important to consider the appropriate formula for the specific capacitor configuration you are working with.

The relative permittivity **(εᵣ)** is a dimensionless quantity that indicates how well a dielectric material can store electric charge compared to a vacuum. It varies depending on the material used as the dielectric.

### Example

Let's calculate the capacitance for a capacitor with 10x10 cm copper plates and a 1 mm ceramic distance.

Given:
Surface area of each plate (A) = 10 cm x 10 cm = 100 cm² = 0.01 m²
Distance between plates (d) = 1 mm = 0.001 m
Relative permittivity of ceramic (εᵣ) = Let's assume it as 8.5 (common value for ceramic)

Using the formula:
**$C = (ε₀ * εᵣ * A) / d$**

$ε₀$ is the permittivity of free space, which is approximately $8.854 x 10^(-12) F/m$.

Plugging in the values:
**$C = (8.854 x 10^(-12) F/m * 8.5 * 0.01 m²) / 0.001 m$**

Calculating the capacitance:
**$C = 7.5254 x 10^(-11) F = 75.254 pF (pico-Farads)$**

Therefore, the capacitance of the given capacitor with 10x10 cm copper plates and a 1 mm ceramic distance is approximately 75.254 pF.
