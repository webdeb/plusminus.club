### Series Circuits: The Path of Current

In a series circuit, components are connected one after the other in a single path. This means that the current flowing through each component is the same, as there is only one path for the current to follow.

#### Key Concepts

- In a series circuit, the total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances of the components.
- The current remains the same throughout a series circuit.
- The voltage across each component depends on its resistance and the current flowing through the circuit.

#### Formula

<MathBlock
  description={mdx(
    `The total resistance $R_\\text{total}$ of a series circuit can be calculated using the following formula:`
  )}
  latex="R_\text{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + ... + R_n"
  explanation={mdx(
    `where $R_1, R_2, R_3, ..., R_n$ are the individual resistances of the components.`
  )}
/>

#### Example

Let's consider a series circuit with three resistors: R1 = 10 ohms, R2 = 20 ohms, and R3 = 30 ohms. The total resistance can be calculated as follows:

{mdx("**$R_\\text{total} = 10 ohm + 20 ohm + 30 ohm = 60 ohm$**")}

Therefore, the total resistance of the circuit is 60 ohms.

#### Illustration

TODO
Here is an illustration of a series circuit:

In the illustration, you can see that the components (represented by resistors) are connected one after the other in a single path. The current (represented by arrows) flows through each component in the same direction.

#### Summary

In a series circuit, components are connected in a single path, and the current remains the same throughout the circuit. The total resistance of a series circuit is the sum of the individual resistances of the components. Understanding series circuits is important for analyzing and designing electrical circuits.

Next, let's explore parallel circuits and how the current divides among different paths in the circuit.
