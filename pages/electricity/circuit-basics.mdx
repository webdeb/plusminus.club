# Circuit Basics

Electric circuits form the foundation of modern electrical systems. They allow the controlled flow of electric current, enabling the operation of various devices and appliances. In this section, we will explore the fundamental concepts of circuitry, including voltage, current, resistance, and the laws that govern their behavior.

## 2.1 Voltage: The Driving Force

Voltage, also known as electric potential difference, is the driving force that pushes electric charges through a circuit. It is a measure of the electrical potential energy per unit charge. Voltage is responsible for creating the flow of current and powering electrical devices. Understanding voltage is essential for designing and analyzing electrical circuits.

## 2.2 Current: Flow of Electric Charge

Current refers to the flow of electric charge in a circuit. It is the movement of electrons or other charge carriers through a conductor. Current is measured in amperes (A) and is denoted by the symbol "I". The direction of current flow is from positive to negative in conventional current flow notation. Understanding current and its behavior is crucial for analyzing and designing circuits.

## 2.3 Resistance: Opposition to Current

Resistance is the property of a material or device that opposes the flow of electric current. It determines how much current is allowed to flow for a given voltage. Resistance is measured in ohms (Î©) and is represented by the symbol "R". Understanding resistance is vital for calculating current flow, voltage drops, and power dissipation in a circuit.

## 2.4 Ohm's Law: The Relationship between Voltage, Current, and Resistance

Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electrical circuits that describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance. It states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage applied across it and inversely proportional to the resistance of the conductor. Mathematically, Ohm's Law can be expressed as:
