# HackPWM Systems

## Concept

The basic idea is to allow the user to create powerful PWM Systems with a small, but flexible set of Program Blocks which can depend on other signals, so it can provide eternal pwm signal output, pwm signals which depend on other signal level (high or low), phase shifting, signal counting etc.

## Built-in Program Blocks

Program Blocks can be created by advanced users.
See source code: https://github.com/webdeb/nanoshim/blob/hackpwm/src/hackpwm/programs.py

### PWM

- `pid` = "PWM"

Configugration parameters:

- `pin` The signal out pin, can be one of OUT1, OUT2, .., OUT6

- `wait_pin` (optional) The pin which enables the PWM Program to run a full cycle

- `wait_level` (optional, default=1) The level which of the `wait_pin` which enables the PWM to run.

### PUSH PULL

The Push Pull program represents mostly the same as the PWM Program and supports the config parameters, but different to the **PWM** program it runs first the full period for the configured `pin` and then it runs the same period for `pin+1`. This is why you should keep attention which `pin` you define.

- `pid` = "PUSH_PULL"

Configugration parameters:

- `pin` The **first** signal out pin, can be one of "OUT1", "OUT2", .. "OUT5". Keep in mind, that the **PUSH PULL** Program will aquire _pin+1_ automatically.

- `wait_pin` (optional) The pin which enables the PWM Program to run a full cycle

- `wait_level` (optional, default=1) The level which of the `wait_pin` which enables the PWM to run.

### PHASE PULSE

The Phase Pulse program requires a reference signal run (wait_pin). When the configured level of the reference signal is available, it will wait for **x** cpu cycles and then change to high for **y** cpu cycles. Before closing its cycle, it will wait for the inverted `wait_level` so it assured, that the Phase Pulse Program runs only once, for each period of the ref signal. To Perform multiple pulses, one could use a `PWM` signal with the `wait_pin` referencing the Phase Pulse signal. This is a first-class feature, so the Phase Pulse Program offers `count_pin` configuration option, which allows the user to set the amount of pulses it should be in high mode.

- `pid` = "PHASE_PULSE"

Configugration parameters:

- `pin` The **first** signal out pin, can be one of "OUT1", "OUT2", .. "OUT5". Keep in mind, that the **PUSH PULL** Program will aquire _pin+1_ automatically.

- `wait_pin` (optional) The pin which enables the PWM Program to run a full cycle

- `wait_level` (optional, default=1) The level which of the `wait_pin` which enables the PWM to run.

- `count_pin` (optional) If set, the user can change the **amount of pulses** of the referenced pin, instead of the usual duty cycle as absolute time.

### Example System configurations

#### Modulation

```json
{
  "title": "Mod example",
  "programs": [
    { "label": "Modulation", "pid": "PWM", "pin": "OUT1" },
    { "label": "HF", "pid": "PWM", "wait_pin": "OUT1", "pin": "OUT2" }
  ]
}
```

#### 4P System

The same program as demonstrated <Link className="font-semibold" href="/hackpwm">here</Link>

```json
{
  "title": "4P",
  "programs": [
    {
      "pid": "PUSH_PULL",
      "label": "Push Pull",
      "pin": "OUT1"
    },
    {
      "pid": "PWM",
      "label": "Tesla",
      "pin": "OUT3",
      "wait_pin": "OUT4"
    },
    {
      "pid": "PHASE_PULSE",
      "pin": "OUT4",
      "wait_pin": "OUT1",
      "count_pin": "OUT3"
    }
  ]
}
```

The default `/store/systems.json` includes the program 6xPWM, 4P and 2F AM. For reference and reset. It is using the integer numbers like **8** (OUT1) instead of "OUT1" which are internally mapped to the actual pin number.

```json
{
  "systems": [
    {
      "programs": [
        { "pin": 8, "label": "F1", "pid": "PWM" },
        { "pin": 9, "label": "F2", "pid": "PWM" },
        { "pin": 10, "label": "F3", "pid": "PWM" },
        { "pin": 11, "label": "F4", "pid": "PWM" },
        { "pin": 12, "label": "F5", "pid": "PWM" },
        { "pin": 13, "label": "F6", "pid": "PWM" }
      ],
      "title": "6xPWM"

    {

        { "pid": "PHASE_PULSE", "count_pin": 10, "pin": 11, "wait_pin": 8 }
      ],
      "title": "4P"
    },
    {
      "programs": [
        { "pin": 8, "label": "Mod", "pid": "PWM" },
        { "pid": "PWM", "wait_pin": 8, "pin": 9, "label": "F1" },
        { "pid": "PWM", "wait_pin": 11, "pin": 10, "label": "F2" },
        { "pid": "PHASE_PULSE", "count_pin": 10, "wait_pin": 8, "pin": 11 }
      ],
      "title": "2F AM"
    }
  ],
  "version": 2
}
```
