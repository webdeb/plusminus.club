1. "Coulomb's Law" by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb:
   Coulomb's Law describes the electrostatic interaction between charged particles. It was formulated by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb in the late 18th century. This law quantifies the force between two charged objects and is crucial in understanding the behavior of electrically charged systems.

2. "Gauss's Law" by Carl Friedrich Gauss:
   Gauss's Law is a fundamental principle in electrostatics, formulated by Carl Friedrich Gauss. It relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the total charge enclosed within that surface. Gauss's Law provides a mathematical method to calculate electric fields based on the distribution of charges.

3. "Electric Potential Theory" by Michael Faraday:
   Michael Faraday extensively studied and developed the concept of electric potential, which is a fundamental quantity in electrostatics. His experiments and theoretical work contributed to our understanding of electric fields and potential energy in charged systems. Faraday's investigations laid the foundation for the development of electric potential theory.

4. "Dielectrics and Polarization" by James Clerk Maxwell:
   James Clerk Maxwell's research on dielectrics and polarization greatly advanced our understanding of electrostatics. He studied the behavior of insulating materials (dielectrics) when subjected to electric fields, including their polarization and the effect on electric flux and capacitance. Maxwell's work on dielectrics helped expand the field of electromagnetism.

5. "Electric Discharge and Ionization" by Johann Wilhelm Hittorf and Julius Plücker:
   Johann Wilhelm Hittorf and Julius Plücker made significant contributions to the study of electric discharges and ionization. They conducted experiments on the behavior of electric currents in gases and investigated phenomena such as cathode rays. Their work laid the groundwork for the development of cathode ray tubes and the understanding of plasma physics.

6. "Electrostatic Induction" by Benjamin Franklin:
   Benjamin Franklin conducted pioneering experiments on electrostatic induction. He discovered the principles of charging objects by induction and the concept of positive and negative charges. Franklin's work with electrostatics and his famous kite experiment contributed to the understanding of electric fields and the nature of electricity.

These are just a few examples of famous works in the field of electrostatics and the notable scientists behind them. Their contributions have significantly shaped our understanding of electrostatic phenomena and paved the way for further advancements in the field of electromagnetism.
